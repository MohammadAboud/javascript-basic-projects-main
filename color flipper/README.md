## Features

### Simple Color Flipper

The "Simple" mode randomly changes the background color among predefined colors: green, red, a shade of purple, and a specific shade of orange.

### HEX Color Flipper

The "HEX" mode generates a random HEX color code and applies it as the background color. It creates a six-character HEX code using numbers (0-9) and letters (A-F).

## Usage

Once the HTML file is opened in a browser, click the "click me" button to change the background color. For the simple mode, the color changes among the predefined set, whereas the HEX mode generates a new random HEX color code.
