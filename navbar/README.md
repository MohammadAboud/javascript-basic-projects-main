# Navbar Project README

This project consists of a simple HTML webpage that creates a responsive navigation bar. It includes a navigation menu with links and social media icons. Additionally, it utilizes JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the webpage, including the navigation bar, links, and social media icons.
- `styles.css`: External stylesheet containing the styles for the webpage elements.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file responsible for toggling the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file (`index.html`) includes a basic structure of an HTML5 document.
- It consists of a `<nav>` element containing a logo, navigation links, and social media icons.
- The navigation links are listed in an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) and anchor tags (`<a>`).
- Social media icons are also placed in an unordered list.

## CSS Styles

- The styles for this project are stored in the `styles.css` file.
- The styles define the appearance, layout, and responsiveness of the navigation bar and its elements.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file (`app.js`) is responsible for adding interactivity to the navigation bar.
- It targets the navigation toggle button and the links element in the DOM.
- When the toggle button is clicked, it toggles a CSS class (`show-links`) on the links element, making the navigation links visible or hidden, effectively creating a responsive menu for smaller screens.

## Running the Project

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure an internet connection to load Font Awesome icons from their CDN.
- Modify the links in the HTML file (`index.html`) to direct to the desired pages.
- Customize styles in the `styles.css` file to suit the project's design requirements.
